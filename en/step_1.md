The material of a GameObject controls how it looks. A material can have a colour and a texture and there are lots of properties that you can adjust to get different effects. 

In the Project view, right-click and choose 'Create' -> 'Material'. Give the material a descriptive name such as 'Red Brick' or 'Snow'. 

Click on the colour next to 'Base Map' in the Inspector and choose a colour for your material.

You can optionally add a texture by clicking on the circle to the left of 'Base Map' and selecting a texture. Note that textures are usually designed for a specific shape of object so the texture will need to be suitable for the shape you will be using it with. The 'Stone Wall' and 'Brick Wall' textures can be used on cube GameObjects.

**Tip:** Adding both a colour and a texture will apply both the colour and texture to the material.

The **Tiling** property controls how the texture repeats. Bigger numbers will make the pattern smaller. 

There are lots of other settings that you can experiment with to control how metallic the surface will be and how it reflects light.
